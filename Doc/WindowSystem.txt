# Should engine contain message loop code?
## why this is talked about
- because thay effects a choice: whether engine need the Process main thread to join it or not
## reality
- Windows do not require UI to be called on MainThread
- iOS do require UI to be called on MainThread
## decision
- After handling initialization, MainThread will be dedicated to UI, act as cycle trigger, window message handler executor
- put most of UI logic code in engine, main program should be cross platform, conditional code is better than seperate build targets since sperate build targets means more files
