# Should engine contain message loop code?
## why this is talked about
- game may not be the only things, a wrapper may be needed and is actually first run by the Game program.
    - iOS
        - main() call UIApplicationMain, which creates AppDelegate and load Main.storyboard
        - Main.storyboard instantiates Views(ui elements) and ViewController classes that control them
        - choice0: main program run the ui loop, engine exposes callbacks, run engine in those callbacks, but what about frame timing?
        - choice1: engine run the ui loop(main thread call UIApplicationMain)
        - does it really matters? Once you call UIApplicationMain you loose control of the MainThread
- because thay effects a choice: whether engine need the Process main thread to join it or not
## reality
- Windows do not require UI to be called on MainThread
- iOS do require UI to be called on MainThread
## decision
- After handling initialization, MainThread will be dedicated to UI module, act as cycle trigger, window message handler executor
- put most of UI logic code in engine, main program should be cross platform, conditional code is better than seperate build targets since sperate build targets means more files
