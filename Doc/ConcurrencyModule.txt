# Queue
## API
- ctorSerial(targetQueue)
- ctorConcurrent(numberOfThreads)
- async(WorkItem)
- 
## question
- must serial queue be tied to 1 core? Seems the sync before taking a job is always necessary, so multiple threads serve a serial queue at different time?
## detail
- every concurrent queue has some private threads for itself, no for serial queue(use some thread on the global queue?)
- or the model should beï¼šDispatchObjects are just frontends, they insert items on to thread specific queues

# WorkItem
