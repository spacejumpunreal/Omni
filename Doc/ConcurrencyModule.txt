# Queue
## API
- ctorSerial: do not support chaining queues as in libdispatch
- async(WorkItem)
- 
## question
- must serial queue be tied to 1 core? No. And the sync before taking a job is always necessary, so multiple threads serve a serial queue at different time?
## detail
- every concurrent queue has some private threads for itself, no for serial queue(use some thread on the global queue?)
- or the model should beï¼šDispatchObjects are just frontends, they insert items on to thread specific queues

# WorkItem
## API
- ctor()
- perform(): execute on current thread immediately
- wait(): //not necessary
- storage
    - use std::function directly: too large(64bytes on MVSC), will use dynmaic allocation when too large
    - function ptr + POD args: can't use lambda(can be good: explicit), no ctor/dtor for args


# Group
## detail
- ctor(queue, count)
