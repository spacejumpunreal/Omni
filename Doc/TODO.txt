# todo
- GfxApi::DX12
	- Clear/Present
		- refactor GfxApi module to provide simple renderer interface
			- rational: better isolation between render logic and GfxApi
				- do not expose classes like command buffer
				
			- use temp allocation to pass parameters, perhaps need new batch allocator
			- make it a one-way(with some query/wait api)
			- very few APIs(like messiah or bgfx)
				- Resource:Create/Update/Destroy
				- Action: DrawPass, DispatchPass
				- query: GpuEventHappened
