# global varible
## eliminate use of static or non static global variable, even for singletons and static local variables
### pros
- performance(should be minimal)
- easy to use
### cons
- make memory leak debug more difficult
- means no need to cleanup

# formating
- sequence of things
	- forward declarations
	- typedefs
	- definitions(they can be quite mixed)
	- global variables
	- local helper functions definitions
	- class function definitions
