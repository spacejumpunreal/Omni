# Dependency Levels
## Prelude
- definition: global headers expected to be included by everyone(internal and external)
- examples: typedefs, platform configs, utility macro definitions(like disable warning macroutils)
## Base
- definition: utils function/types, must be global stateless, no static nonconsts
- examples: lock, containers
## Core
- definition: leaf level singletons that provides service
- examples: allocator module, concurrent module, system
## Hosted
- definition: non leaf level singletons that provides service
- example: animation, GpuApi

# Platform
- platform-agnostic: containers
- platform-specific: NativeFileOps, GUIWindow, warning
